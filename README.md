## Description
_Status HUD Continued_ offers a collection of various elements to display on the HUD. The available elements are:

- **`Altitude`**: displays the player's current height (in meters) in relation to sea level;
- **`Armour`**: displays the equipped armour's average durability (in %). If no armour is equipped, it is hidden;
- **`Body heat`**: displays the player's current drop in body heat. If it is at normal body head (37°C), this element is hidden;
- **`Compass`**: element displays the player's facing direction (in degrees) in relation to North;
- **`Date`**: displays the current date (e.g. `1 Jul`) and an icon for the current season (sprout for spring, sun for summer, leaf for autumn, and snowflake for winter);
- **`Durability`**: element displays the selected item's remaining durability. If the item does not have durability, it is hidden;
- **`Latitude`**: displays the player's current latitude (in degrees);
- **`Light`**: element displays the hovered block's light level. If no block is being hovered over, it is hidden;
- **`Ping`**: displays your server ping in milliseconds. If you are on singleplayer, this element is hidden;
- **`Players`**: displays the number of players currently online;
- **`Rift Activity`**: displays the number of hours until the next change in activity, and changes icons depending on the current activity. If rifts are turned off, this element is hidden. When adding this element to the HUD, a reload may be required;
- **`Room`**: displays a house icon when the player is inside a room (house for large room, cabin for small room or cellar), and a sun icon above when inside a greenhouse. If the player is outside, this element is hidden;

- **`Speed`**: displays the player's current speed (in m/s);
- **`Stability`**: displays the temporal stability (e.g. `76%`) at the player's position if it is below 150%. If the temporal stability is 150%, this element is hidden;
- **`Temporal Storm`**: displays a timer when a temporal storm is approaching or is in progress. Otherwise, it is hidden. When adding this element to the HUD, a reload may be required;
- **`Time`**: displays the current time (e.g. `19:43`) and an icon for the position of the sun relative to the horizon. Support both 24 & 12 hour time;
- **`Time (Local)`**: displays the system's local time;
- **`Weather`**: displays the current temperature (e.g. 21°C) and an icon for the current condition (clear, fair skies, cloudy, rain, snow or hail). Supports multiple temperature scales;
